# Welcome to PortAIO v2!

**ANNOUNCEMENT 9/28/16** : PortAIO is still being updated! The only downside is that school started for me. The only time I have to update is on the weekends but even then I may have an essay or something to do. Basically what I'm saying is, school is my first priority. Hope most of you understand!

I'd like to welcome everyone to PortAIO v2, a complete reboot of PortAIO. We took the time to re-port every single script we had in the older version of PortAIO and then some! We have a whole new common that supports L#'s Menu, TargetSelector, Orbwalker, and Prediction.

- https://github.com/berbb/PortAIO-Loader is the official GitHub.
- https://discord.gg/0zNgmm6ziPDoOfbZ is the official PortAIO discord channel.

###### - Berb : Creator of PortAIO, he basically maintains everything (porting, bug fixing, managing discord/git)
###### - CTTBot : A PortAIO dev that developed/ported the common that we use today, without him none of PortAIO v2 would be possible.

## - Frequently Asked Questions :
1. What is a port? : A port is code used from another script from a completely different scripting platform and making it compatible in our case, EloBuddy.

2. Does PortAIO support all the champions? : As of 6.19 we support every champion up to Kled.

3. Will PortAIO ever have BoL scripts? : As of now no, converting code from LUA to C# is fairly difficult but its currently not any where on our agenda.

4. What is a dual-port? : The dual-port feature allows for you to change the port you are using for your champion/utility, as of 6.19 the dual-port feature supports all champions except kled and 4 utility scripts.

5. Why is PortAIO not on EB? : The rules forbid ported addons on their forums but when I started this project the rule wasn't present, what does that tell you?

6. Why was this project started? : I had the idea of PortAIO back when there wasn't much developers on EB and I wanted to kick-start the community so I thought of this insanely time-consuming project and just made it happen, also to appeal to the users that want to use L# but don't want to invest in it.
