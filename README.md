# Welcome to PortAIO v2!

**ANNOUNCEMENT 9/4/16** : PortAIO is still being updated! The only downside is that school started for me. The only time I have to update is on the weekends but even then I may have an essay or something to do. Basically what I'm saying is, school is my first priority. Hope most you understand!

I'd like to welcome everyone to PortAIO v2, a complete reboot of PortAIO. We took the time to re-port every single script we had in the older version of PortAIO and then some! We have a whole new common that supports L#'s Menu, TargetSelector, Orbwalker, and Prediction.

- https://github.com/berbb/PortAIO-Loader is the official GitHub.
- https://discord.gg/0zNgmm6ziPDoOfbZ is the official PortAIO discord channel.

###### - Berb : Creator of PortAIO, he basically maintains everything (porting, bug fixing, managing discord/git)
###### - CTTBot : A PortAIO dev that developed/ported the common that we use today, without him none of PortAIO v2 would be possible.

## - Frequently Asked Questions :
1. What is a port? : A port is code used from another script from a completely different scripting platform and making it compatible in our case, EloBuddy.

2. Does PortAIO support all the champions? : As of 6.17 we support every champion up to Kled.

3. Will PortAIO ever have BoL scripts? : As of now no, converting code from LUA to C# is fairly difficult but its currently not any where on our agenda.

4. What is a dual-port? : The dual-port feature allows for you to change the port you are using for your champion/utility, as of 6.17 patch the dual-port feature supports all champions except kled & taliyah and 4 utility scripts.

5. Why is PortAIO not on EB? : The rules forbid ported addons on their forums but when I started this project the rule wasn't present, what does that tell you?

6. Why was this project started? : I had the idea of PortAIO back when there wasn't much developers on EB and I wanted to kick-start the community so I thought of this insanely time-consuming project and just made it happen, also to appeal to the users that want to use L# but don't want to invest in it.
