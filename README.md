I'd like to welcome everyone to PortAIO v2, a complete reboot of PortAIO. We took the time to re-port every single script we had in the older version of PortAIO and then some! We also have a whole new common that supports L#'s Menu, TargetSelector, Orbwalker, and Prediction of both SDK & Common!

## - Frequently Asked Questions :
1. What is a port? : A 'port' is converting a script from one community (in our case L#) and making it compatible with another community (in our case EB).

2. Does PortAIO support all the champions? : As of 6.20 we support every champion up to Kled but do not support Ivern (yet).

3. Will PortAIO ever have BoL scripts? : No. Most likely not, most BoL Scripts are encrypted which increases the difficulty of it ever being ported.

4. What is a dual-port? : The dual-port feature allows for you to change the port you are using for your champion/utility, as of 6.20 the dual-port feature supports all champions (except kled & Ivern) and 4 utility scripts.

5. Why is PortAIO not on EB? : The rules forbid ported addons on their forums but when I started this project the rule wasn't present, what does that tell you?

6. Why was this project started? : I had the idea of PortAIO back (around March) when there wasn't much developers on EB and I wanted to kick-start the community so I thought of this insanely time-consuming project and just made it happen, but also to appeal to the users that want to use L# but don't want to invest in it.
